infection in your  knee grew two different organisms, so we consulted our  infectious disease doctors who recommended a course of iv  antibiotics to help treat your infection. because this infection  occured inside of a joint, a longer course of antibiotics is  required. you went multiple times to the operating room to  wash-out your knee of any remaining infection, and your hardware  was removed. most recently you had a portion of tissue grafted  to your knee to provide for better coverage of your wound, along  with skin graft. your kidney function worsened while you were in  the hospital but it appears to have normalized. this should be  followed up with your primary care physician.    we made the following changes to your medications:  started:  vancomycin (antibiotic)  ceftriaxone

joint, a longer course of antibiotics is  required. you went multiple times to the operating room to  wash-out your knee of any remaining infection, and your hardware  was removed. most recently you had a portion of tissue grafted  to your knee to provide for better coverage of your wound, along  with skin graft. your kidney function worsened while you were in  the hospital but it appears to have normalized. this should be  followed up with your primary care physician.    we made the following changes to your medications:  started:  vancomycin (antibiotic)  ceftriaxone (antibiotic)

recommended a course of iv  antibiotics to help treat your infection. because this infection  occured inside of a joint, a longer course of antibiotics is  required. you went multiple times to the operating room to  wash-out your knee of any remaining infection, and your hardware  was removed. most recently you had a portion of tissue grafted  to your knee to provide for better coverage of your wound, along  with skin graft. your kidney function worsened while you were in  the hospital but it appears to have normalized. this should be  followed up with your primary care physician.    we made

&lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt; at &lt;hospital&gt; (&lt;telephone&gt;), for ongoing  issues about your knee. the cultures of the infection in your  knee grew two different organisms, so we consulted our  infectious disease doctors who recommended a course of iv  antibiotics to help treat your infection. because this infection  occured inside of a joint, a longer course of antibiotics is  required. you went multiple times to the operating room to  wash-out your knee of any remaining infection, and your hardware  was removed. most recently you had a portion of tissue grafted  to your knee to provide for better coverage of your wound, along  with skin graft. your kidney function worsened while you were in  the hospital but it appears to have normalized. this should be  followed up with your primary care physician.    we made the following changes to your medications:  started:  vancomycin (antibiotic)  ceftriaxone (antibiotic)    increased metoprolol for blood pressure    followup

any remaining infection, and your hardware  was removed. most recently you had a portion of tissue grafted  to your knee to provide for better coverage of your wound, along  with skin graft. your

recommended a course of iv  antibiotics to help treat your infection. because this infection  occured inside of a joint, a longer course of antibiotics is  required. you went multiple times to the operating room to  wash-out your knee of any remaining infection, and your hardware  was removed. most recently you had a portion of tissue grafted  to your knee to provide for better coverage of your wound, along  with skin graft. your kidney function worsened while you were in  the hospital but it appears to have normalized. this should be  followed up with your primary care physician.    we made
